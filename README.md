# James Hollos - Front-end Developer

### About me:
Hello! I'm James - a front-end developer based in North-West England. I have been coding using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for over 5 years now, however in 2020 I decided to learn the latest technologies in pursuit of turning it into a full-time career.
 My Favourite technologies and tools include but are not limited to: **React** | **Sass** | **VS Code** | **Gulp.js**

### My Projects
###### Here are just some of the projects I have built over the course of 2020, more can be found in my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/HollosJ?tab=repositories).

⚔️ **War Cards** is a site where the user can find various pieces of information about key events in history, in a easy to use and responsive way. This was a good project for me to learn React Router.

🇬🇧 **React Countries** is a site utilizing the [RestCountries API](https://restcountries.eu/). This was my first React portfolio project and was pivotal in my learning of React. Date such as the countries flag, language, currency and more can be quickly located due to its live search feature.

🗺️ **Nordiq Travel** is a mock travel site I built completely from scratch with no design. This was a good introduction to SASS partials, as well as Gulp.js. Using this combination allowed me to create a well-structured source folder, as well as compile it to a more lightweight build using Gulp.

🚗 **Re-Audi** is an Audi UK clone. I am a big fan of the Audi UK website and thought this would be a good challenge for me to re-create it. Like the original site, my version is also built using React.

💼 **My Portfolio** was built using React, which allowed me to pass all my projects as props. I have utilised the [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) form backend for my contact section.
